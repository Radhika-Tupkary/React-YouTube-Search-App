I have used HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap4, ES6 and React.js to create this app.

### Getting Started

Checkout this repo, install dependencies, then start the gulp process with the following:

```
> git clone https://github.com/Radhika-Tupkary/YouTube-Search-App.git
> cd ReactYoutubeApp
> npm install
> npm start
```
